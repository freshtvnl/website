    content: No, we are not talking about crypto currency memes, but about actual
      space travel. ESA, The European Space Agency, has started a screen writing
      competition about European space exploration, and guess what, we are in!
      Yes, we still need to be qualified for participation, but we have all the
      creative people, ideas and tools to make an inspirational film about space
      exploration in the 21st century. Read the following page to learn more
      about who we are, what we stand for and why we are participating in this
      inspiring competition.
